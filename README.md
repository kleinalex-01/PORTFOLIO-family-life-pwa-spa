Project set up is complete. So far, the main Routing is done. Created and added .favicon files in 4 different sizes.

# Log 2 (25.06.04)

Done set up routing with Layout and conditionally rendering a Log-in page whether the user is logged in or not. Layout only shows when user is logged in.

# Log 3 (25.06.05)

Came upon a majority of bugs regarding the conditional log-in page rendering. Refactored code, deleted doubling of BrowserRouter and AuthProvider. Re-wrote AuthProvider "children" logic. Now its back to working order.

# Log 4 (25.06.05)
